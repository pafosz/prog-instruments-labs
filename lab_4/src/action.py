"""
This module defines the `Action` class, which is responsible for managing
the actions of entities on a map within a simulation. It handles the 
creation, movement, and interaction of different entities such as 
predators, herbivores, and plants.

Classes:
    Action: Manages the actions and interactions of entities on the map.

Usage:
    To use this module, create an instance of the `Action` class with a 
    `Map` object and a JSON file containing the proportions of different 
    entities. Call the appropriate methods to initialize entities and 
    manage their actions during the simulation.
